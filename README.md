# üèÅ Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) first, in order to test the project.

Then, clone the repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/luanalessa/alphaflix-backend.git
```

So, in the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install
```
to install the dependencies.

Then, run

```
npm start
```

to run the server.

:stop_sign: Don't forget to repeat the steps above with the [frontend repository](https://github.com/luanalessa/alphaflix-frontend.git) to fully test the project
